Max-Cut is an optimization problem that involves dividing the
nodes (or vertices) of a graph into two disjoint groups, with the goal
of maximizing the number of edges that connect nodes from different groups.

In simple terms, imagine you have a network of friends, and you want to divide them
into two separate groups for two different events. Each connection (edge) between
friends represents a situation where one friend prefers to attend the other friend's
event. The Max-Cut problem seeks to divide the friends into two groups in such a way
that the maximum number of these preferences are satisfied.

The Max-Cut problem is known to be NP-hard, which means that finding an optimal
solution can be computationally difficult as the size of the graph increases.
However, quantum algorithms, like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
(QAOA), have the potential to solve such problems more efficiently than classical
algorithms.
